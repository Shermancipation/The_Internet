          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base.
            With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.
            During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge
            those experiments into the your app.</p>
          <h2>What is Github?</h2>
          <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.  It lets you and others work together
            on projects from anywhere useing those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

              all our respositories.  Other developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached
              problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code based with features they wanted
              to add</p>
